<h3>About Education for Ministry</h3>
<p>Do you have questions about your faith? Most people do, and most find it challenging to get answers. 
<strong>Education for Ministry (EfM)</strong> was developed by the School of Theology in Sewanee, Tennessee, to provide a mechanism for people to work through those questions. 
This four-year course of study provides the framework for the group to connect faith to their daily lives through reading and discussion.</p>

<p>Meeting once a week in small groups with people from your neighborhood, led by mentors trained to facilitate the experience, you will begin to think theologically, 
reflect faithfully, and speak civilly when confronted by beliefs and principles in opposition to your own. 
And that’s something we can all appreciate in today’s world.</p>

<p>By being an EfM participant, you will learn how to articulate your faith. You will learn how to shape your faith into action. 
You will become involved in ministries in your community and you will make a difference.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 1975, more than 100,000 people have participated in this vital program. 
EfM groups meets regionally in nearly every diocese of The Episcopal Church, in six provinces of the Anglican Communion, and some in virtual classrooms with participants from across the globe. 
We would love to have you join us!</p>
