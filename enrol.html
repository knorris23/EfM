<h3>Enrollment & Fees</h3>

<p>While the Education for Ministry program is a four-year curriculum, participants enroll for one year at a time. 
Each program year is 36-weeks long. Groups generally begin their year in either September or January.</p>

<p>Each EfM group must have a minimum of six students.
To maintain an effective learning environment and to provide participation for everyone, EfM groups may not have more than twelve participants.
In the case of a move during the academic cycle, a participant may transfer to another group.</p>

<p>The required texts and materials for study are provided in print form, although students will need to provide their own Bible.
E-books of the Reading and Reflection Guides are also provided to all.
Participants who desire e-book versions of the study texts may purchase them through a number of booksellers.</p>

<p>
The full yearâ€™s fee is paid at the time of enrollment participants. 
The current fee is $475. Participants in groups under institutional sponsorship (parochial or diocesan) pay a discounted fee of $375.
In addition, there are scholarships based on group size.
In groups of 8 or more participants, one can be awarded a tuition reduction to $175.
In groups of 10 or more an additional participant may receive the reduction to $175.
</p>

<p>
To assist students in need, a fee reduction provision is available on the basis of the total enrollment of the group.
Scholarship funds also may be available from the EfM Alumni/ae Association Scholarship Fund.
</p>

<p>
Enrollment in a seminar group is done through the mentor who will provide a link for online registration.
Since groups generally begin their year in either September or January, participants enroll in the month or two prior to the start date.
To find a group near you, contact your diocesan coordinator.  The mentor can tell you if space is available in the group.

To enroll in the Bloomington EfM group, contact the diocesan coordinator at the Episcopal church, located at downtown Bloomington on Kirkwood.
